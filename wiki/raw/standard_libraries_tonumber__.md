### `tonumber (e [, base])`

When called with no `base`, `tonumber` tries to convert its argument to a number. If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a number, then `tonumber` returns this number; otherwise, it returns **fail**.

The conversion of strings can result in integers or floats, according to the lexical conventions of Lua (see [§3.1](#3.1)). The string may have leading and trailing spaces and a sign.

When called with `base`, then `e` must be a string to be interpreted as an integer numeral in that base. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter '`A`' (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, '`B`' represents 11, and so forth, with '`Z`' representing 35. If the string `e` is not a valid numeral in the given base, the function returns **fail**.
