# tostring()

**Category**: Standard Libraries

### `tostring (v)`

Receives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a human-readable format.

If the metatable of `v` has a `__tostring` field, then `tostring` calls the corresponding value with `v` as argument, and uses the result of the call as its result. Otherwise, if the metatable of `v` has a `__name` field with a string value, `tostring` may use that string in its final result.

For complete control of how numbers are converted, use [`string.format`](#pdf-string.format).
