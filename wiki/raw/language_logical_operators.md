# Logical Operators

### 3.4.5 – Logical Operators

The logical operators in Lua are **and**, **or**, and **not**. Like the control structures (see [§3.3.4](#3.3.4)), all logical operators consider both **false** and **nil** as false and anything else as true.

The negation operator **not** always returns **false** or **true**. The conjunction operator **and** returns its first argument if this value is **false** or **nil**; otherwise, **and** returns its second argument. The disjunction operator **or** returns its first argument if this value is different from **nil** and **false**; otherwise, **or** returns its second argument. Both **and** and **or** use short-circuit evaluation; that is, the second operand is evaluated only if necessary. Here are some examples:

```lua
10 or 20            --> 10
10 or error()       --> 10
nil or "a"          --> "a"
nil and 10          --> nil
false and error()   --> false
false and nil       --> false
false or nil        --> nil
10 and 20           --> 20
```
