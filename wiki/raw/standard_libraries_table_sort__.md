### `table.sort (list [, comp])`

Sorts the list elements in a given order, *in-place*, from `list[1]` to `list[#list]`. If `comp` is given, then it must be a function that receives two list elements and returns true when the first element must come before the second in the final order, so that, after the sort, `i <= j` implies `not comp(list[j],list[i])`. If `comp` is not given, then the standard Lua operator `<` is used instead.

The `comp` function must define a consistent order; more formally, the function must define a strict weak order. (A weak order is similar to a total order, but it can equate different elements for comparison purposes.)

The sort algorithm is not stable: Different elements considered equal by the given order may have their relative positions changed by the sort.
